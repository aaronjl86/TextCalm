# TextCalm

TextCalm helps break anxious texting loops. Users check less, draft faster, and recover emotionally in minutes—not hours. It’s a pause button for spirals, not therapy, crisis support, advice, or a chatbot. TextCalm doesn’t read or store your messages.

## What It Is

- A pause button for anxious texting loops that gives users time to reflect before sending or checking messages.
- A tool that helps users draft messages offline and manage emotional responses during stressful texting moments.
- A simple interface that encourages mindful communication without storing or analyzing your personal messages.

## What It Is Not

- Not a form of therapy or crisis counseling.
- Not a chatbot or AI responder providing advice.
- Not a platform that reads, stores, or transmits your messages.

## Privacy Guarantees

TextCalm runs locally in your browser and **never** uploads, stores, or analyzes any of your messages. Your drafts remain on your device until you decide to copy or send them yourself.

## Current Status

This project is at a prototype stage and open to contributions. Core functionality is implemented, but features like onboarding, accessibility improvements, and responsive design are in progress.
